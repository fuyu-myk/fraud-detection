A supervised machine learning project for NUS IT1244. Done by [Cheong Zhi Kai Lionel](https://github.com/fuyu-myk), [Ishan Lokhandwala](https://github.com/sasukweila), [Wayne Foo Fong Way](https://github.com/NoobDoctor21) and [Koh Liang Han](https://github.com/Nagisato612).

# How to run the project:

A script has been created to test the best model, [`predict.py`](https://github.com/fuyu-myk/fraud-detection/blob/main/Code/predict.py). You may run the program yourself. If you wish to test values other than the given, kindly make a copy of the dictionary found in the program.

Kindly also note that the code was written on Google's Colaboratory environment, it is advised to run the code there. Regardless, all the required libraries can be found in [`requirements.txt`](https://github.com/fuyu-myk/fraud-detection/blob/main/Code/requirements.txt).
